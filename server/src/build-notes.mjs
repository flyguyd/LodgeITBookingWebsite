          'The booking website becomes its own product. Split out of the engine repo (Dave, 2026-08-22): this repo carries the guest-facing site (site/ - one HTML, one CSS, one vanilla JS file, framework-free per spec §23) AND the only public-facing service in the booking stack (server/ - a zero-dependency Node server). The engine is now fully private; guests only ever touch this service, which serves the static site, rate-limits per IP, and forwards exactly FOUR allow-listed guest calls (status, availability, sessions, events) to the engine\u0027s private booking API over its own HMAC service client. Anything not on the allow-list does not exist publicly.',

          'CONFIGURATION IS WIRING ONLY: PORT, ENGINE_URL, CLIENT_KEY, CLIENT_SECRET, optional SITE_PUBLIC_URL and rate-limit tunables - no business configuration lives here; everything operational is driven from Lodge Ops through the engine. THE SERVER: node:http, zero deps; static serving with traversal-proof path resolution (decode, null-byte refusal, resolved-prefix check) and directory-ish paths landing on index.html; guest API calls rate-limited (default 120/60s per IP, X-Forwarded-For last-hop aware) then signed with the shared three-way HMAC format (ts.METHOD.path.sha256(rawBody) - identical strings in the engine\u0027s ServiceAuthGuard and Lodge Ops\u0027 BookingEngineService; change one side and everything 401s); engine-down maps to a calm 503 BOOKING_UNAVAILABLE; POST bodies capped at 64KB. HEARTBEAT: on boot and every minute the server reports {version, uptimeSec, siteUrl} to the engine\u0027s site-heartbeat endpoint, so Lodge Ops sees this service\u0027s health on the Booking Engine page without this service exposing ANY admin surface - /health (version + engine reachability) is its only non-guest route. Pure logic lives in server/src/lib.mjs so harnesses execute shipped code: signHeaders, createRateLimiter, safeSitePath, mimeFor, forwardTargetFor.',

Simpler than the engine\u0027s on purpose - this service is zero-dependency node with no build step and no database, so there is no npm install and no schema guard. The sync never touches /opt/lodgeit-site/.env, and an unreachable engine after deploy is a loud WARNING, not a failure: the site is designed to stay up and serve its calm unavailable state while the engine is down.',

Caller\u0027s directory never changed. VERIFIED end to end in a sandbox with a substituted install root: real install ran, both first-run gates fired with their messages, the verify tail ran against a LIVE installed copy (ok/version green, the engine-down warning branch rendered), and REAL rsync was proven to preserve an existing .env under --delete while removing stray files and never syncing .git.',

A zero-cost in-process recorder counts everything a guest does to this service - pages and assets served (with bytes), the four forwarded API calls timed per route at the site edge (so the figures include the engine round trip), rate-limited 429s, oversize 413s, guessed-URL 404s, and every call answered 503 because the engine did not respond - plus the process itself (memory, event-loop lag).

The heartbeat body simply gains stats: {...} - the engine caps it at 16KB and strips it back out of status so only the stats endpoint carries it. VERIFIED twice over: the pure recorder from the SHIPPED lib.mjs under an injected clock (8 checks: rate-window emptying while totals persist, ring wrap at 400 samples, percentile honesty) and the LIVE chain (site \u2192 engine \u2192 signed stats read: static hits/bytes/misses, 429 counts matching the driven burst, per-route counts and percentiles, the 501 forward counted as an error on its route, zero engine-down in a healthy chain).
