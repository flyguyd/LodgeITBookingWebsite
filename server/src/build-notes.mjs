          'The booking website becomes its own product. Split out of the engine repo (Dave, 2026-08-22): this repo carries the guest-facing site (site/ - one HTML, one CSS, one vanilla JS file, framework-free per spec §23) AND the only public-facing service in the booking stack (server/ - a zero-dependency Node server). The engine is now fully private; guests only ever touch this service, which serves the static site, rate-limits per IP, and forwards exactly FOUR allow-listed guest calls (status, availability, sessions, events) to the engine\u0027s private booking API over its own HMAC service client. Anything not on the allow-list does not exist publicly.',
        detail:
          'CONFIGURATION IS WIRING ONLY: PORT, ENGINE_URL, CLIENT_KEY, CLIENT_SECRET, optional SITE_PUBLIC_URL and rate-limit tunables - no business configuration lives here; everything operational is driven from Lodge Ops through the engine. THE SERVER: node:http, zero deps; static serving with traversal-proof path resolution (decode, null-byte refusal, resolved-prefix check) and directory-ish paths landing on index.html; guest API calls rate-limited (default 120/60s per IP, X-Forwarded-For last-hop aware) then signed with the shared three-way HMAC format (ts.METHOD.path.sha256(rawBody) - identical strings in the engine\u0027s ServiceAuthGuard and Lodge Ops\u0027 BookingEngineService; change one side and everything 401s); engine-down maps to a calm 503 BOOKING_UNAVAILABLE; POST bodies capped at 64KB. HEARTBEAT: on boot and every minute the server reports {version, uptimeSec, siteUrl} to the engine\u0027s site-heartbeat endpoint, so Lodge Ops sees this service\u0027s health on the Booking Engine page without this service exposing ANY admin surface - /health (version + engine reachability) is its only non-guest route. Pure logic lives in server/src/lib.mjs so harnesses execute shipped code: signHeaders, createRateLimiter, safeSitePath, mimeFor, forwardTargetFor.',
